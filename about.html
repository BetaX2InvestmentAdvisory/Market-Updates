    <h1>Our Origin</h1>
            <p>Since high school, our founder, Johnson Lee has played mutiple 10 week stock market simulations for business class. 
            Ever since turning 18 and being able to open a TFSA to invest in the stock market, Johnson started applying his knowledge
            and experience learnt from playing the stock market simulation to his TFSA portfolio. The purpose of this project / blog is
            to track the journey and document Johnson's analysis of the market to see if it turns out to be what is analyzed.
