Technology is getting better by the day and majority of the technology we use consist of chips that are embedded inside the device that are not in clear view. An example of chips in technology we use every day is our devices like phones and laptop. Whether you have an Apple, Android phone, Mac or PC there is a processing chip in the phone/computer that allows the device to run.
