I"î<p>Every year Apple hosts their Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) and present their newest technology that they are developing or products that will be hitting the market in the fall. This year WWDC was no different. The 2 hour conference was divided up by products: iOS 14, watchOS, Home and macOS.</p>
<h3 id="ios-14">iOS 14</h3>

This year Apple introduced many new features that took their user interface to look even better. Although most of the features like widgets, picture in picture has already been implemented on Android, Apple took it to the next step by making them more user friendly and gives user the ability to customize. Another key feature Apple has built into iOS 14 is giving users the ability to easily use their iPhone, this can be seen through making Siri not take up the entire screen when activated, app library that is categorized to easily be able to find the app that is being looked for. In my opinion there were two features that broke barriers</p>

<ol>
  <li>The iPhone being able to act as a car key to BMW 2021 5-series with NFC and in the feature this could be applied to other wireless key cars using Appleâ€™s U1 chip.</li>
  <li>The translate app that will be able to detect what language it picks up through the microphone and translate it to one of the eleven language. This will be able to be done when the iPhone is offline.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alibaba has experienced success over the last two decades from having the highest IPO price for a technology stock ever at the time it public to where it is today. In the upcoming months there will be multiple key events happening. The events are analyzed below.</p>

<h4 id="1-jack-mas-departure">1. Jack Maâ€™s departure</h4>
<p>For the last two decades when you talk about Alibaba the first name that comes to mind has been Jack Ma. Alibaba has been quietly changing that over the last few years with the last few step being taken on September 10th of 2018. On that day Jack Ma announced he will be stepping down from the position of Chairman at Alibaba in the coming year. Following that it has been reported that Jack Ma will be leaving the BOD after 2020 shareholders meeting which will be happening in June.</p>

<p><strong>My thoughts</strong></p>

<p><img style=" float:left; padding-right:20px;" src="/images/Alibaba's Future/Daniel Zhang.jpg" width="10%" />
The price of Alibaba stock has priced in Jack Maâ€™s departure. He has spent the past few year slowly preparing Alibaba for this day. Starting from stepping down from CEO to stepping down from chairman to eventually leaving the BOD soon. 
Jack Maâ€™s successor, Daniel Zhang (seen on the left) should be able to take Alibaba greater heights although there will definitely be setback along the way as Alibabaâ€™s main revenue segment, core commerce has reached maturity stage of the business growth cycle. Mr. Zhang would need to deploy a strategy that will continue to allow Alibabaâ€™s revenue to grow at the rate it has in past years. Given Mr. Zhang track record of inventing Singleâ€™s Day that contributes to Alibaba recording breaking revenue every year, it is possible to believe he will come up with a strategy that will assist Alibaba to continue growing.</p>

<h4 id="2-rising-us-and-china-tension">2. Rising US and China Tension</h4>
<p>Before COVID-19 hit US and China were under trade war that had investors predicting Alibaba would take a significant hit from as it would slow the growth of its expansion into the US and reduced consumer buying power in China due to tariffs applied on certain good. On January 15th 2020 the two country agreed on a phase 1 deal where both side agreed to rollback a portion of the tariffs, this led the market to believe that the tension between the two country was going back to normal. However it is possible that tension will come back as President Trump has been declaring for China to pay for the damage caused to other nation by COVID-19. At the same time Chinaâ€™s plan to take control of Hong Kong will not fair well between the two nations.</p>

<p><strong>My thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Alibaba has shown through the US and China trade war that it could continue to operate and grow as the trade war caused Chinese to buy more goods domestically and did not slow Alibabaâ€™s earnings much. This could however lead revenue to take a hit as international commerce and retail made up 7% of total revenue and 8.5% of total commerce revenue.</p>

<h4 id="3-senate-passing-hfcaa-on-us-regulated-listing">3. Senate passing HFCAA on US regulated listing</h4>
<p>On May 20th the senates passed Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA). The purpose of this act is to ensure companies that are listed on the US stock exchange are not owned or controlled by a foreign government. This act is viewed as targeted towards China, in the past Chinese companies have denied access to its audited work stating that it is against the Chinese laws for those documents to leave the country. The legislation still needs to be passed by the House of Representative before being passed onto President Trump.</p>

<p><strong>My Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>If the legislation ends up getting pass the House of Representative and President Trump. It could lead to potential movement in the stock price as Alibaba is one of the 165 companies that was listed by SEC in 2019 to be affected by the legislation. If the worst case scenario of delisting occurs the stock will take a huge hit as investors will look to sell off before the stock becomes illiquid. This problem was also addressed on Q1 conference call as the projection of earnings growth was dropped to a lower amount due to multiple factors including this legislation.</p>
