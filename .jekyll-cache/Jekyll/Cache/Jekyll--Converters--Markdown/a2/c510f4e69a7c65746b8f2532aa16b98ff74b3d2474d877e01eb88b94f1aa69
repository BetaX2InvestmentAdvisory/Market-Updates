I"<p>Every year Apple hosts their Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) and present their newest technology that they are developing or products that will be hitting the market in the fall. This year WWDC was no different. The 2 hour conference was divided up by products: iOS 14, watchOS, Home and macOS.</p>

This year Apple introduced many new features that took their user interface to look even better. Although most of the features like widgets, picture in picture has already been implemented on Android, Apple took it to the next step by making them more user friendly and gives user the ability to customize. Another key feature Apple has built into iOS 14 is giving users the ability to easily use their iPhone, this can be seen through making Siri not take up the entire screen when activated, app library that is categorized to easily be able to find the app that is being looked for. In my opinion there were two features that broke barriers</p>
