### Breakdown of Microsoft ###
Microsoft was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. As of  July,2020 8-K report Microsoft has three revenue segments. The segments are: Personal Computing, Intelligent Cloud and Productivity & Business Processes. Below is the weighting of each revenue segment.<br>

### Shift to Cloud and New Normal ###
Under Nadella’s leadership dating back to 2014, Microsoft has rapidly started adapting to the new trend of internet of things(IoT). This is most noticeable through the intelligent cloud segment. It has been growing at an astonishing rate seeing around 17 -25% growth YoY. This process has been accelerated even further with COVID-19 as Microsoft announced on June 26th a $450 million write off with all physical stores to be closed permanently.

TikTok, the most downloaded app in Q1 of 2020 was created in September 2016. Ever since its creation the app has been trending and growing its users at a unprecedent growth. However recently President Trump has stated that he is going to ban TikTok through executive action. Before President Trump announced banning TikTok there was news on Microsoft being a potential buyer.  

### My Opinion ###
Microsoft has been a reliable blue-chip stock throughout the last 20 years. Today it has around a 6% weighting in the S & P 500 and around 11% weighting in the NASDAQ 100. The above shows that Microsoft has a big influence on the market. Personally, I believe the shift of closing all physical store was a great strategic move as it allows Microsoft to focus on the intelligent cloud segment while adapting to the new normal where everything is attempted to be done virtually. From past figures the personal computing segment has not experienced much growth and closing the stores will allow the fund to help accelerate intelligent cloud development. The potential acquisition of TikTok would be an interesting move as Microsoft would be able to reach a new demographic of consumers but at the same time it would create a new segment that would require capital that would take  away from the cloud’s development.
