Technology is getting better by the day and majority of the technology we use consist of chips that are embedded inside the device that are not in clear view. An example of chips in technology we use every day is our devices like phones and laptop. Whether you have an Apple, Android phone, Mac or PC there is a processing chip in the phone/computer that allows the device to run. When talking about chipmakers the first one that use to come to mind is Intel.

### Intel Dethroned ###
On July 9th Nvidia overtook Intel as the most valuable company in the chipmaking business. Nvidia has been the rising star in the industry as it started off producing chips for video game graphics, as AI started to trend recently Nvidia created a new segment and took their experience from making video game graphic card to AI as the manufacturing process is similar.<br>

Days after Intel lost its long time #1 position in the industry, they announced their 2020 Q3 earning results which revealed another disappointment to its shareholders. Intel announced major delay of 12 month as first shipment is expected by 2022 in its next-generation chips (7nm). This is a major setback as another notable name in the industry AMD already has 7nm chips. To make matters worse Intel discussed potentially outsourcing chip making which is unheard of from a company that is primary known for designing and making chips.

### Aftermath of the earning ###
Following intel’s earning call AMD and TSMC stocks both climbed higher with AMD going up 7% and TSMC following the next 3 days going up 23%. As mentioned previously AMD is a competitor of the Intel 7nm chips and they benefited greatly from the news that Intel could potentially be exiting the industry and some of Intel market share in the business could be taken. Another plus is that their product could continue to dominant the market for an extended 12 months.

TSMC on the other hand benefited greatly from the news as they are a foundry (A company that makes chip designed by another company). The news showed that TSMC could start seeing orders from Intel down the future and that there could be more orders coming in from AMD as Intel 7nm will be facing a 12-month delay.

### My Opinion ###
Intel might have just lost its position in the industry as they are behind compared to competitors and they have started shifting to other methods of making revenue as seen through the pie chart and table below.  Along with that there have been numerous problems with Intel’s operation as it also experienced delay with its 10nm chip, and its management has done nothing in attempt to fix. Lastly the stock (INTC) has reflected this as the stock has been down 20% since the beginning of 2020, while it’s other competitor 50% plus gains during the same period of time.
