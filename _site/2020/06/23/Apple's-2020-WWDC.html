<h2>23 Jun 2020 - Beta X2 Investment Advisroy</h2>

<p><p>Every year Apple hosts their Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) and present their newest technology that they are developing or products that will be hitting the market in the fall. This year WWDC was no different. The 2 hour conference was divided up by products: iOS 14, watchOS, Home and macOS.</p>
<h3 id="ios-14">iOS 14</h3>
<p><img src="/images/Apple 2020 WWDC/iOS 14.jpg" width="100%" />
This year Apple introduced many new features that took their user interface to look even better. Although most of the features like widgets, picture in picture has already been implemented on Android, Apple took it to the next step by making them more user friendly and gives user the ability to customize. Another key feature Apple has built into iOS 14 is giving users the ability to easily use their iPhone, this can be seen through making Siri not take up the entire screen when activated, app library that is categorized to easily be able to find the app that is being looked for. In my opinion there were two features that broke barriers</p>

<p>1 .	The iPhone being able to act as a car key to BMW 2021 5-series with NFC and in the feature this could be applied to other wireless key cars using Apple’s U1 chip. <br /><br />
2 .	The translate app that will be able to detect what language it picks up through the microphone and translate it to one of the eleven language. This will be able to be done when the iPhone is offline.</p>

<h3 id="home">Home</h3>

Apple Home is a newer product line relative to other product lines. Some of the new implementations that stood out in the conference was how tasks like locking doors, closing garage doors and turning off the lights could conveniently be hooked up and controlled from the iPhone. Another implementation that Apple presented was making the users TV able to access cameras around the house and use picture in picture just like iOS when someone enters the pre-set detection zone.</p>

<h3 id="watchos">watchOS</h3>
<p><img src="/images/Apple 2020 WWDC/WatchOS.jpg" width="100%" /> 
This year was no different than any other year’s conference Apple presented an update version of watchOS as it has in the past few years. Living in a time of a pandemic Apple has implemented a hand washing timer to make sure its user are washing their hand the right way. Along with hand washing timer Apple mainly focused on making the watchOS look more user friendly by letting users create their own watch home page and giving them the ability to share with their friend. When users discover an watch homepage by a third party they can easily apply it to their own watch and download the app needed to ensure they experience the greatest time with the new homepage they just downloaded.</p>

<h3 id="macos">macOS</h3>
<p><img src="/images/Apple 2020 WWDC/macOS.jpg" width="100%" /> 
This is a product line that many Apple enthusiasts looks forward to every year as the Mac was the product Apple started out with before developing all these different line that we know of today. This year Apple introduced a new macOS called the “Big Sur”. Apple’s goal with this version of the OS is to provide mac user with similar experience they get when using an iPhone by making the icons and logos highly identical and provide more privacy. 
Most importantly Apple confirmed a rumors that have been in the news.
Apple will now be making Macs with their own chips instead of Intel. This change will allow more cross platform app development to be done on all Apple device as they all run on the system now.</p>

<h3 id="final-takeaways">Final Takeaways</h3>
<p>1 .	Apple continues to expand its ecosystem to trap more users into using their products and is attempting to use word of mouth by having user share with each other <br /><br />
2 . Apple may have just set the trend for the future with phones that can unlock cars. If this feature ends up being popular Apple has just taken a big lead in the market as car with wireless key are starting to become a norm <br /><br />
3 .	Apple creating its own chip instead of using Intel chip should reduce production cost and keep everything in house but at the same time R&amp;D should also see an increase</p>
